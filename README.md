# Timetable for TAMK courses üìÖ

_Not affiliated with TAMK, unofficial project for a course._

This the repository for our fullstack timetable app, made by [@HenriSjoblom](https://github.com/HenriSjoblom), [@kristianka](https://github.com/kristianka) and [@Zennrr](https://github.com/Zennrr)!

You can search tamk courses and create your own timetable!
Note: this is proof-of-concept version of the main product. Over the course, we made through documentation how to make the project. 

This project has a proper CI/CD pipeline (excluding deploy), we used Trello for tracking issues and what work to do. We used pull requests like in a real project, the main branch is projected.

Both frontend and backend have strict linting and style rules! We used `eslint` and `prettier`.
